This is a project to create an Etch-a-Sketch game for The Odin Project.

I learned:

1. How to dynamically build a grid of divs in a fixed size container using javascript
2. How to use mouseover event listeners and button click event listeners
3. a review of how to use flexbox to arrange elements of my webpage
